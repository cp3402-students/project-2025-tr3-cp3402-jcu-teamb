This guide explains how to update content on the Baizonn Learning Centre website.

## 1. Managing "Our Team" (Teachers)

1.  Log in to the WordPress Dashboard.
2.  Go to **Posts > Add New**.
3.  **Title:** Enter the Teacher's Name (e.g., "Ms. Jennifer").
4.  **Content:** Enter the teacher's biography and qualifications in the main text area.
5.  **Category (Crucial Step):** In the right sidebar, locate the **Categories** box and check **"Teachers"**.
    *   *Note: If this is not checked, the teacher will not appear on the page.*
6.  **Featured Image:** In the right sidebar, click **Set featured image** and upload the teacher's photo.
7.  Click **Publish**.

## 3. Editing Class Schedules
The schedule on the "Schedule" page uses a table format.

3.  **To change text:** Click directly on the text (e.g., "$100") and type the new value.
